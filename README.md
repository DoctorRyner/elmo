# elmo

Are you upset that you can't use `<script></script>` in your elm application? Well, I can understand why Evan want us to use purely elm in our app but sometimes we can't replace something like unity with elm and we HAVE to use pretty complicated solutions or libraries but no more. I present you my compiler wrapper which fix __script__ tag replacement of elm output
