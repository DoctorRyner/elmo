# elmo

Have you ever been upset that you can't use `<script></script>` in your elm application? Well, I can understand why Evan wants us to use purely elm in our app but sometimes we can't replace something like unity with elm and we HAVE to use pretty complicated or twisted solutions and even entire libraries but fear no more! I present you my compiler wrapper which fixes __script__ tag replacement of elm output
